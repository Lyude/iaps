This is a specially modified HDAPS driver for specific models of the Lenovo IdeaPad. Most of the work on this was originally done by Javier Pedro, however originally this driver did not actually work with HDAPSD on Linux. I have made some modifications to his work to fix that, and I am currently working on making more modifications to make it into a proper driver.
This driver has been tested with the Lenovo S10-3t with hdapsd and I can confirm it works perfectly on this model, however BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN TRYING THIS WITH OTHER MODELS. If your model is not compatible with this driver it will probably just not work, however since this driver has to directly access some ports, it does have the potential to kill something. Don't blame me if your computer sets on fire or something.
